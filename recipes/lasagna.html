        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>There is nothing better than comfort food. This recipe has been passed down through my family for over a decade now. The rich and creamy cheeses paired with a delicate tomato sauce, it could not be a more ideal combination. This dish is perfect for large groups or even for a small get together.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>24 oz marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, ground</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 oz cottage cheese</li>
            <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>4 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a deep pan or dutch oven over medium/high heat and add 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 lb ground beef and diced onion. Saute, breaking up the meat for 5 minutes or until beef is no longer pink. Add pressed garlic and saute another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup wine and stir for 2 minutes or until wine is nearly evaporated. Add 3 cups marinara, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp sugar and 2 Tbsp parsley. Bring to a simmer then cover and cook 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 16 oz Cottage Cheese, 15 oz Ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, 1 egg and 2 Tbsp parsley. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375˚F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and 9 lasagna noodles. Cook until al dente according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a deep 9x13 casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, spread on 1/3 of the meat sauce and sprinkle with 1 cup mozarella cheese. Spoon on and spread the top with 1/2 of your cheese sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of noodles: Add 3 noodles, 1/3 meat sauce, 1 cup mozarella cheese, 1/2 cheese sauce. Add 3 noodles, remaining 1/3 meat sauce, remaining 1 cup mozarella.</li>
            <li>Poke 9-12 toothpicks over the surface of your lasagna (to keep the foil from sticking to the cheese). Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden. Let lasagna rest 30 min before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
