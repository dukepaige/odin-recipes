        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These baked meatballs are on my montly rotation. This is one of my sister`s favorite meals and she requests them often. If there`s some leftover, I usually make meatball sliders. These meatballs are low maintenance which makes them even better.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound 80% lean ground beef</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian flat leaf parsley (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray.  Combine the meat, egg, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, garlic, onion, black pepper and parsley in a bowl. Stir just until combined, do not over mix. Add a Tablespoon or two of water as needed to keep a wet mixture.</li>
                <li>Use a medium cookie scoop or spoon to scoop the meat. Then form into 1 1/2″  balls and place on the pan.</li>
                <li>Bake uncovered for 17-20 minutes, or until no longer pink in the middle. Turn halfway through, so the bottoms don’t brown.</li>
                <li>Simmer meatballs with marinara sauce (if desired) for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve meatballs on their own or serve over spaghetti noodles. Top with freshly grated parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if desired.</li>
            </ol>
